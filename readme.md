### Brief guidethrough to understand the library

<p>

      This simple library allows the users to acess Brazil Central Bank
(BACEN) data by acessing its API. In short, there are three R scripts
which work jointly: ***Bacen_URL***, ***Bacen_API*** and
***Bacen_Form***.  
      The script ***Bacen_URL*** is responsible for creating the URL
where the data is available. The ***Bacen_API***, as the name says,
connects with the BACEN API and extracts the info and converts it to a
readable format. At last, the ***Bacen_Form*** script is a short form
which interacts with the user in order to gather some information
necessary to extract the data.
